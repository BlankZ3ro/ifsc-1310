     <h2>About Each Page</h2>
     <h3>The Gordo-Prototype Project</h3>
     <p>The Gordo-Prototype Project is the my starter HTML page that I created. I have left it unedited and without CSS on purpose as to focus on HTML tagging. Page use is solely to keep practice HTML and not for any other educational purposes. If you are interested please by all means look at the code of it should you need to look at some example HTML tagging. I have also added the assignment page should you like to look at what the prompt for the page was!</p>
     <h3>CSS-Demo Page</h3>
     <p>The CSS Demo page is for as the name implies, for a CSS Demo. The page has it's own css style script, and should you like to take a look at it, the HTML has good examples of class-ids and many CSS examples.</p>
     <h3>The Positioning-Lab Assignments</h3>
     <p>The Positioning-Lab Assignments were a class assignment, helping to better understand float and absolute positioning. They are good examples of both should you need to reference them for better understanding. If you would like to try the lab for yourself, I would recommend going to the "Positioning Lab Template and copy and paste the HTML code into your own workspace and try to work them out youself! The link to the assignment page can be found <a href="https://thomaswallace.net/2020/10/26/css-positioning-lab-2/">here</a></p>
     <h3>Froggy and Logo Assignments</h3>
     <p>The Froggy and Logo assignments where two minor assignments focused on learn/understand particular concpets. Froggys focused on positioning using CSS, and Logo was all about understanding optimizing images for website usage.</p>
     <h3>Dragon Project</h3>
     <p>The Dragon Project is a mock client website setup. Acting as if SpaceX had hired me to create a website for their Dragon spacecraft. Using all of the knowledge from the year, we create our micro webpage with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enhancment is a web development style that roots itself from the content and expands from there. Like writing a novel, or any bit of text for that matter, the meaning is the most important part of the piece. The meaning, or content in this case is the most important part, it lays out the information we want on our site, and gives us a frame of reference as we style and build to make our web pages look and feel smooth. click <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-it-matters-e80c7aaf834a/">here</a> to see an additional piece on the topic.</p>
