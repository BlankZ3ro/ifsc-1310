     <h2>About Each Page</h2>
     <h3 class="assignment-1">The Gordo-Prototype Project</h3>
     <p class="assignment-1">The Gordo-Prototype Project is the my starter HTML page that I created. I have left it unedited and without CSS on purpose as to focus on HTML tagging. Page use is solely to keep pratice HTMl and not for any other educational purposes. If you are interested please by all means look at the code of it should you need to look at some example HTML tagging. I have also added the assignment page should you like to look at what the prompt for the page was!</p>
     <h3 class="assignment-2">CSS-Demo Page</h3>
     <p class="assignment-2">The CSS Demo page is for as the name implies, for a CSS Demo. The page has it's own css style script, and should you like to take a look at it, the HTML has good examples of class-ids and many CSS examples.</p>
     <h3 class="assignment-3">The Positioning-Lab Assignments</h3>
     <p class="assignment-3">The Positioning-Lab Assignments were a class assignment, helping to better understand float and absolute positioning. They are good examples of both should you need to reference them for better understanding. If you would like to try the lab for yourself, I would recommend going to the "Positioning Lab Template and copy and paste the HTML code into your own workspace and try to work them out youself! The link to the assignment page can be found <a href="https://thomaswallace.net/2020/10/26/css-positioning-lab-2/">here</a></p>
