<h2>Who is Gordo?</h2><!--subtitle of the main title-->
<p>Gordo is a space monkey put simply, however he is one of the first monkeys to go to space! Gordo aka "Old Reliable" he was launched into space December 13, 1958. Sadly when he was returning to earth on the same day, the rocket's paracute failed and ended up crashing in the south atlantic. His body and the rocket were never recovered</p>
<h3>Particulars on the Flight Itself</h3><!--subtitle of the subtitle-->
<p>The rocket used to launch Gordo into space was called a <strong>"Jupiter AM-13 rocket"</strong> and was lauched at the Atlantic Missle Range in Cape Canaveral. The flight traveled move than 1,500 miles and reach a remarkable height of 310 miles (500 km). Remarkably scientist who where observing Gordo as he assended, say that Gordo suffered from no ailments as he entered space, other then a slight slowing of the his pulse.</p>
<p>Gordo's flight lasted about 15 minutes and in those 15 minutes Gordo got the experience around 8.5 minutes worth of weightlessness. After his rentry to Earth, sadly the rocket's paracute failed and the vessal and Gordo were lost somewhere in the South Atlantic ocean. Despite attempts to recover him and the rocket, they have no been found. In the words of Tyrone Davis: <q> What goes up I know, one day has got to come down Lord, have mercy</q>and sadly for Gordo, coming back down was the end of him.</p>
<blockquote>What goes up I know, one day has got to come down Lord, have mercy</blockquote><cite>From Tyrone Davis's "What Goes Up (Must Come Down)"</cite>
<h4>Other Monkeys and Apes in Space</h4>
<p> of course Gordo is not the first monkey to go to space (though Gordo has the coolest name) The United States, The French, and the Soviets all sent apes and monkey's into space to study the effects of space travel on organisms similar to that of humans. In total about 32 non-human primates flew in the space program(s).</p>
